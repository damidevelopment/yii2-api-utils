# Yii2 API module

## Installation

To be able to install this module, first you have to modify your `composer.json` file like this.

```
{
    "minimum-stability": "dev",
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "git",
            "url": "gogs@gogs.damidev.com:dami-libraries/yii2-api-module.git"
        }
    ]
}
```

You can use https url version when you don't have ssh key in gogs.

```
{
    "minimum-stability": "dev",
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "git",
            "url": "https://gogs.damidev.com/dami-libraries/yii2-api-module.git"
        }
    ]
}
```

After this you can call composer require.

```
composer require dami-libraries/yii2-api-module
```

## Authentication

As default every request for logged user must contain `Access-Token` header. You can configure this behavior thru `damidevelopment\apiutils\controllers\RestController::$authenticator` property.

## Multilangual API output

ContentNegotiator works with `Accept-Language` header. If you need multilangual API, you need to add `Accept-Language` header to request and define acceptLanguages array in app params. See example bellow.

```
// config/params.php
return [
    'acceptLanguages' => [
        'en' => 'en-GB', // accept en as en-GB
        'cs-CZ',         // accept cs or cs-CZ as cs-CZ
        'de',            // accept de only (should not be used, better use de => de-DE)
    ]
];
```

See [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) to find language code.

If no `Accept-Language` header is found or language is not supported, first language in acceptLanguages array will be used as default. If no acceptLanguages is defined, is used base app language.

TODO make generating of language list in `acceptLanguages` param automatic, not user defined.

## Multiple requests with same ID

When you need better quality API you can send multiple requests to the same endpoint. You just need to send `X-Request-Id` header and all requests with the same request ID within 30 sec will return the same result as if you send one request.
